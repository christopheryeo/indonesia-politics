"""Move stranded article backlinks back into an entity note's ## Coverage block.

Why this exists
---------------
``ingest_cascade.py`` used to carry its own inline copy of the Coverage-append
logic which did ``text.rstrip() + "- [[article/...]]"`` — appending to the END
OF THE FILE rather than into the ``## Coverage`` section. On any entity note
whose ``## Coverage`` is not the last section (country notes are laid out
``## Coverage`` -> ``## Outlets Based Here`` -> ``## Notes``), every cascaded
backlink landed under the trailing section instead.

That inline copy has since been replaced by a delegation to
``patch_coverage.py``, which inserts correctly. This script repairs the notes
already damaged by the old behaviour.

What it moves
-------------
Only lines matching ``- [[article/...]]`` that sit OUTSIDE the ``## Coverage``
block. Prose, ``[[entity]]`` links, and outlet links in other sections are left
alone — the ``article/`` target prefix is the discriminator.

What it deliberately does NOT do
--------------------------------
It does not touch ``mentionCount``/``articleCount``. Those were already
incremented correctly when the link was first appended; only the line's
placement was wrong. Re-counting here would double-count.

Deduplication: if a stranded link's target is already present in the Coverage
block, the stranded copy is dropped rather than duplicated.

Usage:
  python3 scripts/repair_stranded_coverage.py            # dry run (default)
  python3 scripts/repair_stranded_coverage.py --write    # apply
  python3 scripts/repair_stranded_coverage.py --write --log   # apply + append domain logs
  python3 scripts/repair_stranded_coverage.py --report out.txt
