"""Vault-wide wikilink lint + auto-fix.

Extends check_links.py's detection with safe, mechanical repairs.

Pass 0 (normalize) runs FIRST, before everything else, and is always on
(disable with --skip-normalize). It repairs the two STRUCTURAL corruption
classes check_links.py flags as hard failures:

  0a. TARGET-EMBEDDED NESTED links -- an inner [[slug|Display]] that got
      embedded inside another link's *target*, e.g.
        [[1000895-[[japan|Japan]]-[[canada|Canada]]-sign|...]]
      is collapsed back to [[1000895-japan-canada-sign|...]] by rewriting
      each nested inner link to its bare slug, to a fixed point. Decided
      locally per link (does an inner '[[' open before this link's '|'?),
      never by global '[[' vs ']]' counting -- global counting lets one
      malformed link elsewhere in a file make a valid standalone link look
      nested and get destroyed (a real bug this pass was rewritten to avoid).
  0b. ISOLATED single-']' closes -- a link closed with one ']' , e.g.
        [[nisar-keshvani|Nisar Keshvani]
      gets its missing bracket restored.

  An inner link embedded in another link's DISPLAY (after '|') is not changed
  by Pass 0. It is handled later by the Coverage-label pass, which retains the
  valid outer target and regenerates its label from the cited article Summary.

  Why first: the entity linker below reasons about what text is "already
  inside a link". Target-embedded corruption must be gone before it runs.

Then the three "stale or broken link" classes that don't require judgment:

  1. ALIAS-ONLY links -- rewritten in place to the canonical piped form
     [[real-filename|Display]], preserving whatever text was already
     displayed (an existing |label if piped, otherwise the original
     bracketed text). This never changes what a reader sees, only what
     the link resolves against -- see entity_cascade_procedure.md, "Why
     piped links, always".

  2. BROKEN article links whose target is already a fully-compiled note
     sitting in Inputs/articles/<month>/ (frontmatter starts `type:
     source`, has a `sourceId` field, has a `## Summary` section) --
     relocated into entities/article/<month>/ under the same filename,
     entities/article/catalog.md regenerated, and a backfilled log.md
     entry appended (one line per article, never batched). This is the
     "compiled but never moved" pattern found repeatedly in this vault
     (see entities/article/log.md's 2026-07-07 backfill entries) --
     relocating one article can surface more of the same (an article's
     own body cites further pending articles), so this step repeats to
     a fixed point.

  3. Two known YAML frontmatter corruption patterns, repaired if and
     only if applying the fix makes the frontmatter parse validly under
     PyYAML (never applied speculatively, never kept if it doesn't):
       - unquoted '#' as the first character of a flow-list item, e.g.
         tags: [#sensitive] -> tags: ['#sensitive']
       - a backslash-escaped apostrophe inside a single-quoted flow
         scalar, e.g. aliases: ['Women\\'s Institute'] ->
         aliases: ["Women's Institute"]

  4. MALFORMED COVERAGE LABELS -- a valid article target whose display label
     embeds a truncated wikilink is rebuilt from that cited article's own
     `## Summary`. The target, source note and entity counts are untouched.
     Each changed entity receives an append-only audit entry. Disable only
     this pass with `--skip-coverage-labels`.

  5. ORPHAN ENTITY BODIES -- an entity note with no outgoing link to another
     entity is scanned for explicitly named peer entities in its prose. YAML,
     Coverage, Source, AI Context, template comments, existing links, and the
     note's own name are excluded. Only unambiguous multiword names and
     uppercase acronyms are linked. Disable only this pass with
     `--skip-entity-body-links`.

Pass 6 (--link-entities) is OPT-IN, off by default, and runs LAST. It
backfills inline links in article prose: for each article note it finds the
first plain-text mention of a known entity in ## Summary / ## Key Points and
wraps it in a piped link, using the article's own ## Related Entities and
## Covered By as the trusted vocabulary, augmented by multiword displayName/
alias matches from people/organisations/place/country/topic (outlet excluded
from augmentation -- its names collide with ordinary prose; a covering outlet
is still linked when it's in this article's ## Covered By). First mention only
(the vault links on first mention, then uses plain text), longest name first,
never inside an existing link. This is the one pass that edits prose content
rather than just link syntax, which is why it is opt-in rather than default;
it depends on Pass 0 having already run, so it is never allowed before it.

Anything left after these passes needs a judgment call and is only
reported, never guessed at:
  - BROKEN links with no match anywhere (entities/ or Inputs/articles/)
    -- the referenced entity plain doesn't exist yet; create it via
    entity_cascade_procedure.md, don't invent a stub here.
  - YAML errors that don't match either known pattern above.
  - UNLINKED ENTITY warnings when --link-entities was not passed (run it to
    backfill), or entities whose display name never appears verbatim in prose.

Like check_links.py, this always excludes documentation/template files
(index.md, catalog.md, log.md, _template.md, scripts/*.md,
entities/decisions/*.md) and Inputs/ -- those are never auto-fixed, only
ever reported if --include-docs is passed (report-only; still never
written to).

  python3 scripts/fix_links.py --dry-run        # report only, write nothing

                                                   relocation is always

                                                   the Inputs -> entities/article
                                                   gap regardless of who's
                                                   linking to it)
  python3 scripts/fix_links.py --skip-relocate  # skip pass 2
  python3 scripts/fix_links.py --skip-alias     # skip pass 1
  python3 scripts/fix_links.py --skip-yaml      # skip pass 3

Run this regularly -- after any ingest/cascade batch, or on a schedule --
